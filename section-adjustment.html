						<p> This is a web-app developed with Rails. The pourpose of it is to help little
							transport companies with the accountability.
							By registering all the expences (invoices, tickets etc) which belong to
							companies, categories and vehicles, the user can see how much has been
							spent per year or per month for every category, company and vehicle.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="approach">
						<h2>Approach</h2>
						<p> I've first started by trying to understand how the accoutability of a
							company works. Then by talking to a potential user, I've tried to
							understand the critical points of how the costs should be calculated and
							which are those costs.
							Then I've sketched the neccessary views and the neccessary objects/class
							that were needed to make the app function. Then by researching and trial and
							error I've started developing the web-app.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="conclusion">
						<h2>Conclusions</h2>
						<p>I've learnt a lot during the process of developing this app. First and more
							important thing that I've learnt is the importance of testing, and the more
							the app was growing the more important the tests were.
							I've also learnt the importance of sketching and developing ideas on how the
							app should be. I've also learnt the importance of communication with a
							possible user to understand fully what the app should do.

						<p> I’ve decided to develop this project for free for the company of my parents,
							this way the company would had a presence on-line and I would had the possibility
							to improve my skills. The company had already bought a domain name on an Apache
							server so I had to adapt consecutively. This project was one of my first projects
							after Makers Academy but my intention now is to start working on it again so
							I could improve it with my newly acquired knowledges.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="approach">
						<h2>Approach</h2>
						<p>Since I did not know anything about php I decided to follow a course first
							and then I’ve started developing it. First I tried to understand what type
							of audience could visit the website and then by keeping in head that I started
							sketching and writing the possible content of every page. After making sure
							everything worked I deployed it on the server.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="conclusion">
						<h2>Conclusions</h2>
						<p>During this project I understood the importance of planning, because without
							planning the possibilities to lose a lot of time are a lot higher because
							there is no idea how the final product could look.

						<p> Since I did not knew a lot about php before starting the website for my parents company,
							I decided to take a course so I could learn it. This course taught me the fundamentals
							on php. As a final project in the course I had to build a CMS (content management system),
							this project was made of two parts the blog part which every user could access and see all
							the blog posts that had been published and an admin part where the registered users could
							manage their own blog posts categories and contents.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="approach">
						<h2>Approach</h2>
						<p>I decided to work on this project without using a framework because from my point of view
							a framework is better understood when facing the needs that created that framework.
							It was hard at the beginning but by using the resources from the course and also
							all the resources on line I’ve made it through.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="conclusion">
						<h2>Conclusions</h2>
						<p>I liked working with PHP because it is very easy to understand when coming from a
							Ruby environment and also is very easy to understand in general, but I prefer
							by far ruby and it’s frameworks because they were created with testing in mind
							so they are far more easy to test. And I know that tests are very important when
							working on medium large projects

						<p> I wanted to improve my web-designing skill because I really want to become a
							front-end developer (I like to make things look cool), so I decided to take
							a course on web-design, and as a final project in this course I had to create a
							website for an imaginary client Omnifood. The main focus of this web-site was to
							attract user to subscribe on a monthly plan for food delivery. The course explained
							every step on the project but I prefered to pause it and do it by myself and then
							check with the course.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="approach">
						<h2>Approach</h2>
						<p>Before starting coding I started planning, sketching and thinking about the content.
							After having all the content ready I started coding and with every line of code I
							understood how important is to keep the code organized and clean, because as the
							project grows the possibility to have a mess in code is really high so the best
							way to avoid it is to keep it clean from the beginning.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="conclusion">
						<h2>Conclusions</h2>
						<p>During this project I understood how JQuery plugins works and how to arrange CSS
							code and also how the box model in HTML works with all the properties.
							I also gained a deeper understanding of design principles as colors, fonts, images,
							arrangement of the content and also how to optimize the website before launching it online.

						<p>This was a project that I worked in team with other fellow coders when I was
							still studying at Makers Academy. This project was meant to be used by new
							students who were starting the course at Makers Academy, by registering the
							student gets an access to all the students that had already finished the course
							and after consulting its criterias the new user can pair with the senior student
							for a pair programming session.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="approach">
						<h2>Approach</h2>
						<p>We first started by defining the MVP (minimum viable product) and after deciding
							that we started deciding the tasks for each pair, front-end and back-end. We rotated
							so all the people in the group could develop both sides of the project. The whole
							project was developed in two days by four people.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="conclusion">
						<h2>Conclusions</h2>
						<p>During the period developing this project I understood the importance of communication
							skills and listening skills when working in teams. I also learnt how important is
							to develop an MVP before starting working on a project, because when having an MVP
							is far easier to respect the deadline rather than getting lost on features.
