The emphasis of this project was combine all the recent skills that I've
acquired through the completion of different courses, as the course on web
design by using HTML5 and CSS3, the course on responsiveness using media
queries to display different layouts for different displays as so the web-site
displays nicely on different screen sizes and different resolutions but still
maintaining as fast as possible for a better SEO.


As proven consequently the web site received A rating for PageSpeed and A
rating for YSlow score, and also received 93/100 points for Desktop and 79/100
points for mobiles on Google PageSpeed insights.

I'm currently working in
improving the speed for mobiles but that will require more work since the
points are base on the fact that I load all the content and not just the
content that is displayed since I'm usign a full page scroll plugIn which loads
the whole content, I'm planning in learning ReactJs to make it more modular.
